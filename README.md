# Seoul_Metro
- This is an analysis of the free riders of Seoul subways. In Korea, elders over the age of 65 are given free passes on subways and the team goal was to analysis how we can solve the subway financial problems by moderating the number of free subway takers through gentle social nudges.
- One of my cancelled projects for a class at my university. Despite the change of topic, I exercised a lot of programming skills for these files and saw them as lucrative results for someone who is dealing with data analysis.
- The uploaded files are from my part of the work only. I will respect the work of my teammates and not take away their credit.
- The datasets are from open public data platforms and I will upload them as well.
